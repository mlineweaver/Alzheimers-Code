    "\n",
    "* Prevalence & incidence:\n",
    "    * Over 7 million Americans have Alzheimer's Diseas. \n",
    "    * 1 in 9 people that are 65 years of age or older.\n",
    "    * 200,000 American have younger-onset dementia (age 30-64 years)\n",
    "    * Approximately 500,000 people were diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2024\n",
    "* Economic burden:\n",
    "    * Global cost by 2030 is expected to be 2 trillion for care. Dependent on the severity of the disease, the annual range for one person in America is a wide range. For mild AD, it is 468.28 and for severe AD it is 138,023.97 per person in a year. These are based off the total (direct and indirect) treatment and \"loss of treatment time\". (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212109923000948?via%3Dihub#sec3)\n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle) \n",
    "    * 2/3 of Americans with Alzheimer's are women. \n",
    "    * Older Black women are almost 2x as likely and older Hispanics are 1.5x as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites.\n",
    "    * The greatest risk if increasing age. \n",
    "    * Family history, the risk increase with each family member that has the illness.\n",
    "    * Bad sleep habits, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. \n",

    "    * Misplacing things\n",
    "    * Decreased or poor judgement with decisions\n",
    "    * Social withdrawal\n",
    "* Diagnosis:\n",
    "    * Begins with acknowledgement of symptoms, current lifestyle patterns, medications, history, overall health, and changes in behavior. With enough suspicion or request from the patient it is common to carry through with testing. Memory/Problem solving testing. Fluid testing to rule out other possible factors. Measure proteins associated with Alzheimers in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). CT, PET, and MRI to solidify diagnosis from other tests. Looking for degradation of brain. (https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-symptoms-and-diagnosis/how-alzheimers-disease-diagnosed)\n",
    "* Standard of care treatments (& reimbursement):\n",
    "    * 12 million Americans provide unpaid care for a family member or friend with dementias.\n",
    "    * The value of unpaid care hours is valued at $413.5 billion. \n",
    "    * 30% of caregivers are age 65 or older. \n",
    "    * Over 1/3 of dementia caregivers are daughters. \n",
    "    * Most caregivers live with the person with dementia. \n",
    "    * 70% of the lifetime cost of caring for someone with dementia is covered by familites. \n",
    "    * There are not enough dementia care specialists in 55% of communities. \n",
    "* Disease progression & prognosis: \n",
    "    * 1/3 older Americans dies with Alzheimer's or another dementia. \n",
    "    * 6th leading cause of death among people age 65 and older in 2022. \n",
    "    * 5 stages: preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, severe dementia\n",
    "    * Alheimer's disease is often diagnosed in the mild dementia stage \n",
    "    * People with Alzheimer's live between 3 and 11 years after diagnosis, but some can live 20 years or more. \n",
    "    * Prognosis depends on how far the disease has advanced when diagnosed. \n",
    "    * Untreated vascular risk factors, like high blood pressure, are associated with a faster rate of progression of the disease. \n",
    "* Continuum of care providers:\n",
    "    * Beginning with a primary care provider suspison following questioning and gathering of previous medical history. After the diagnosis it is useful to set up with both neurologists near by and other memroy supportive teams to assist with individual living patterns. The most effective continuum of care providers are communities or organizations which support the patients with constant contact and the ability to go to their home.

    "The purpose of this notebook is to analyze whether different neurological disorders impacts the MMSE score. Based on Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., this stands for Mini-Mental State Examination: detection of cognitive impairment. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6464748/) It was determined to not be a strong test by itself, but within an entirety of examinations may narrow down the severity of the neurological impacts. With a mix of sociological testing and biological markers, patients with probable Alzheimers can be more easily detected. The only contraindication toward diagnosis Alzheimers with any of these examinations is the confusion of other clinical diagnosis hidden in the patient. Comparing the MMSE score between patients with alzheimers and other diseases may provide a clear view on the similarites the broad dementia has with other neurological impairments. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data set comes from 84 patient organ donations, analyzed with a plethora of tests prior to death. Important information includes: age, diagnosis age, death age, fresh brain weight, other diagnosis, biomarkers, other sociological examinations, etc. As seen in the count,the split between \"Dementia/other\" and \"No dementia\" are equally split with 42. Creating a larger funnel, there are 17 patients with diseases outside of Alzheimers, allowing further analysis of this impact on neurological defecit. The second graph demonstrates the range of MMSE scores, along with the p-value based off of an ANOVA score. It seems the null hypothesis is accepted (there is not a significant difference with patients of only alzheimers and other diseases when comparing MMSE score). The control subjects are a comparison with patients of no diagnosed Alzheimers or other diseases. (ADD DATA REGARDING MEREDITHS ANALYSIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data and its comparison to the project goal, it seems to follow a pattern of no significant additions to neurological disorder when having other diseases with Alzheimers. When comparing these results with Bowler et al. it may help explain the reason (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9193204/). While other diagnosis, such as vascular dementia, evolve in similar pattern, it may not have an additive effect. Instead, the disorder may be apart of the Alzheimers or easily confused in with the other examinations. Furthermore, MMSE score seeks out mild dementia like disorder, meaning that there being no significant difference within the three groups may support the use of the test. \n",
